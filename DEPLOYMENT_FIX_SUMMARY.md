# Vercel Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
The SafePlay application was failing to deploy on Vercel with the error:
```
Error: The file "/vercel/path0/app/.next/routes-manifest.json" couldn't be found.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `next.config.js` file where the `output` configuration was set to `process.env.NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE` without a default value. When this environment variable was undefined, Next.js failed to generate the required manifest files, including `routes-manifest.json`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` Configuration
Added proper environment variable configuration to ensure `NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE` is set to an empty string:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run prisma:generate && npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "env": {
    "ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK": "0",
    "NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS": "true",
    "NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE": "",
    "NEXT_DIST_DIR": ".next"
  },
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

### 2. Key Changes Made
- Set `NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE` to empty string instead of undefined
- Added proper function runtime configuration for API routes
- Configured deployment region and clean URLs
- Added build output directory specification

### 3. Verification Results
After the fix:
- ✅ `routes-manifest.json` is now generated (12,562 bytes)
- ✅ All required manifest files are present:
  - `app-build-manifest.json`
  - `app-path-routes-manifest.json`
  - `build-manifest.json`
  - `images-manifest.json`
  - `prerender-manifest.json`
  - `routes-manifest.json`
- ✅ All 60 static pages generated successfully
- ✅ All API routes properly configured

## Files Generated Successfully
```
-rw-r--r--  app-build-manifest.json     (31,001 bytes)
-rw-r--r--  app-path-routes-manifest.json (10,407 bytes)
-rw-r--r--  build-manifest.json         (969 bytes)
-rw-r--r--  images-manifest.json        (510 bytes)
-rw-r--r--  prerender-manifest.json     (13,083 bytes)
-rw-r--r--  routes-manifest.json        (12,562 bytes)
```

## Deployment Status
✅ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The application now builds successfully and generates all required files for Vercel deployment. The routes-manifest.json error has been resolved.

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Commit all changes to git repository
2. Push to main branch
3. Deploy via Vercel dashboard or CLI
4. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - Database connection strings
   - Authentication secrets
   - AWS credentials
   - Stripe keys
   - Staging password

## Build Command Verification
The build process now works correctly with:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate && npm run build
```

All 60 pages are generated successfully including both static and dynamic routes.
