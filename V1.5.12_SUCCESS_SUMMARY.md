## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`app/parent/subscription/page.tsx`** - Enhanced subscription flow
2. **`components/subscription/payment-setup.tsx`** - Dual-mode payment collection
3. **`app/api/version/route.ts`** - Updated to v1.5.12

### **Key Code Changes:**

#### **Subscription Page - Payment Method Collection for All Paid Plans:**
```typescript
// üîß CRITICAL FIX: Show payment method collection for ALL paid plan upgrades
if (!hasActiveSubscription) {
  // New users: Address collection first, then payment
  setShowAddressCollection(true);
} else {
  // Existing users: Skip address collection, go straight to payment
  setShowPaymentSetup(true);
}
```

#### **PaymentSetup Component - Dual API Routing:**
```typescript
if (isExistingUserUpgrade) {
  // Existing user upgrade - use modify-fixed endpoint
  endpoint = '/api/stripe/subscription/modify-fixed';
  requestBody = { priceId: stripePriceId, paymentMethodId: paymentMethod.id };
} else {
  // New user signup - use subscription endpoint
  endpoint = '/api/stripe/subscription';
  requestBody = { priceId: stripePriceId, paymentMethodId: paymentMethod.id, isSignupFlow: true };
}
```
