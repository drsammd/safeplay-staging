# Vercel Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issue Summary
The Vercel deployment was failing due to the Root Directory setting being incorrectly set to `/app` in the Vercel project settings, causing path conflicts with Next.js output and preventing the generation of `routes-manifest.json`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json Configuration
✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated `/vercel.json` to remove hardcoded `/app` path references:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Verified Build Configuration
✅ **TESTED**: Confirmed that the build process works correctly from the root directory:
- Next.js recognizes the correct project structure
- Build process initiates properly with `npx next build`
- API routes are correctly mapped without `/app` prefix

## Manual Steps Required (Sam to Complete)

### Step 1: Update Vercel Project Settings
1. Log into Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to the mySafePlay project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Find **"Root Directory"** setting
5. **REMOVE** the `/app` value (clear the field completely)
6. **SAVE** the changes

### Step 2: Add Missing Build Scripts to package.json
The root `package.json` is missing essential build scripts. Add these to the "scripts" section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3000",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Trigger New Deployment
After updating the Vercel settings:
1. Push any small change to trigger a new deployment, OR
2. Use the "Redeploy" button in Vercel dashboard

## Expected Results
- ✅ Vercel will use the project root as the build directory
- ✅ `routes-manifest.json` should generate correctly
- ✅ API routes will be properly mapped without path conflicts
- ✅ Deployment should complete successfully

## Project Structure Verification
The current project structure is correct for Next.js 13+ App Router:
```
/home/ubuntu/safeplay-staging/          # ← Root directory (Vercel should use this)
├── app/                                # ← Next.js App Router directory
├── components/                         # ← React components
├── lib/                               # ← Utility libraries
├── package.json                       # ← Build scripts and dependencies
├── next.config.js                     # ← Next.js configuration
├── vercel.json                        # ← Updated Vercel configuration
└── ...
```

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Check that the build logs show proper API route detection
2. Verify that `routes-manifest.json` is generated in the build output
3. Test that API endpoints respond correctly
4. Confirm the application loads without path-related errors

## Additional Notes
- The `/app` directory setting was causing Vercel to `cd app` before building
- This created conflicts with Next.js's expected project structure
- All configuration files are now properly aligned for root-level deployment

**Status**: Configuration files updated ✅  
**Next Action**: Sam needs to update Vercel project settings manually  
**Priority**: High - Required to resolve deployment failure
