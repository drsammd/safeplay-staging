If you prefer to implement your desired new pricing structure instead:

**Sam's Desired Structure:**
- üÜì **Free Plan** (no payment required)
- üí∞ **Starter Plan:** $9.99/mo | $100/yr  
- üöÄ **Professional Plan:** $19.99/mo | $200/yr
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Enterprise Plan:** $29.99/mo | $300/yr

We can create these new products in Stripe and configure the application accordingly.
