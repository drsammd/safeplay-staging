# GitHub Repository Setup for Automatic Deployment

## Current Status

✅ **Version 1.2.8 Successfully Deployed**
- Production URL: https://safeplay-staging-d86q8jf7v-my-safe-play.vercel.app
- Geoapify dropdown fixes are live and functional
- Automatic deployment workflows are configured and ready

## Setting Up GitHub Repository Connection

To enable automatic deployments via GitHub Actions, you need to connect this project to a GitHub repository. Here's how:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `safeplay-staging` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it private if needed
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/safeplay-staging.git

# Or if using SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/safeplay-staging.git

# Push existing code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository settings, add these secrets:

1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret" and add:

**Required Secrets:**
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel access token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: `team_A9nHFC80TBwnAeQYZDIv7lqR`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: `prj_E7PfBt1iQxg2Br3dt0EN6ySnSIWl`

### Step 4: Get Vercel Access Token

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your profile → Settings → Tokens
3. Create a new token named "GitHub Actions Deployment"
4. Copy the token and add it as `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

### Step 5: Test Automatic Deployment

Once connected, test the automatic deployment:

```bash
# Method 1: Use the deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh 1.2.9

# Method 2: Manual commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger automatic deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Workflow Files Already Created

The following GitHub Actions workflows are ready:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Deploys on push to main
- `.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml` - Creates preview deployments for PRs

## Benefits of Automatic Deployment

✅ **No Manual Deployment Requests**: Push to main = automatic deployment
✅ **Rapid Testing**: Production deployment is the primary testing method
✅ **Version Management**: Automated version tracking and updates
✅ **Consistent Deployments**: Same process every time
✅ **Preview Deployments**: Test changes in PRs before merging

## Current Deployment Methods

Until GitHub connection is set up, you can still deploy using:

### Vercel CLI Direct Deployment
```bash
# Deploy current version to production
vercel --prod --confirm

# Deploy with specific settings
vercel deploy --prod --token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Manual Version Updates
```bash
# Update version in package.json
npm version 1.2.9 --no-git-tag-version

# Update version-tracker.tsx
# Edit components/version-tracker.tsx manually

# Deploy via Vercel CLI
vercel --prod --confirm
```

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to GitHub** following the steps above
2. **Test automatic deployment** with a small change
3. **Use the deployment script** for future version updates
4. **Monitor deployments** in GitHub Actions tab
