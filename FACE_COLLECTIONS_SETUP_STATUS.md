# Face Collections Setup - Status Report

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Prisma Database Query Error
- **Problem**: Script was trying to select `businessName` field that doesn't exist in Venue model
- **Error**: `Unknown field 'businessName' for select statement on model 'Venue'`
- **Solution**: Updated the Prisma query to only select valid fields (`id` and `name`)

### 2. TypeScript Import Issues
- **Problem**: Script was trying to import `.ts` files directly in Node.js
- **Solution**: Compiled TypeScript files to JavaScript and updated imports

### 3. AWS Permission Handling
- **Problem**: Script would crash when AWS permissions were insufficient
- **Solution**: Added graceful error handling for missing AWS permissions

## ‚úÖ Current Status

### Database Connection: WORKING ‚úÖ
- Successfully connects to Prisma database
- Successfully queries Venue model
- Found 1 venue: "SafePlay Demo Venue" (ID: cmdhn80zs0001nlm2g75s242q)

### Script Logic: WORKING ‚úÖ
- Prisma query now uses only valid fields
- Error handling for AWS permission issues
- Proper collection ID generation: `safeplay-venue-{venue.id}`
- Database update logic for `faceCollectionId` and `faceRecognitionEnabled`

### AWS Integration: READY (Pending Permissions) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Script is ready to create face collections
- Needs AWS IAM permissions:
  - `rekognition:CreateCollection`
  - `rekognition:ListCollections` (optional)
  - `rekognition:DescribeCollection` (optional)

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. `/scripts/setup-face-collections.js` - Fixed Prisma query and added error handling
2. `/lib/aws/config.js` - Compiled from TypeScript
3. `/lib/db.js` - Compiled from TypeScript

## üìÅ Files Created

1. `/scripts/test-face-collections-setup.js` - Test script to verify logic without AWS calls

## üöÄ Next Steps

When proper AWS permissions are available, the script will:

1. Create AWS Rekognition collection: `safeplay-venue-cmdhn80zs0001nlm2g75s242q`
2. Update database record:
   ```sql
   UPDATE venues 
   SET faceCollectionId = 'safeplay-venue-cmdhn80zs0001nlm2g75s242q',
       faceRecognitionEnabled = true
   WHERE id = 'cmdhn80zs0001nlm2g75s242q'
   ```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify database connectivity and logic:
```bash
node scripts/test-face-collections-setup.js
```

Run the main script (will handle AWS permission errors gracefully):
```bash
node scripts/setup-face-collections.js
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Complete

The face collections setup script is now fully functional and ready for use once AWS permissions are configured properly.
