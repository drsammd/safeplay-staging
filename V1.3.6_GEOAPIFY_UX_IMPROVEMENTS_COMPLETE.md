**Date:** $(date)  
**Improvement Type:** User Experience Enhancement

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

**Problem Solved:** The previous address entry was "clunky and confusing" - users had to type entire addresses manually, leading to punctuation and typographical errors.

**Solution Implemented:** Enhanced address autocomplete with smooth dropdown selection, 4-5 suggestions, and click-to-select functionality.

## ✅ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced GeoapifyService (lib/services/geoapify-service.ts)**
- **Reduced Input Threshold:** From 3+ to 2+ characters for suggestions
- **More Lenient Requirements:** Only needs letters (removed requirement for both letters AND numbers)
- **Optimized Suggestion Count:** Limited to exactly 5 suggestions (down from 8) as requested
- **Better User Experience:** Users get helpful suggestions much sooner in their typing

### 2. **Improved AddressAutocomplete Component (components/verification/address-autocomplete.tsx)**

#### **Faster Response Times:**
- **Suggestion Threshold:** Reduced from 4+ to 2+ characters
- **Debounce Timing:** Faster response (300ms instead of 400ms)
- **Validation Timing:** Faster validation (400ms instead of 500ms)

- **More Prominent Dropdown:** Enhanced border (border-blue-300), better shadow (shadow-2xl)
- **Better Header:** Clear instructions with icon "📍 X address suggestions found - click any to select"
- **Larger Click Areas:** Increased padding (p-4 instead of p-3) for easier interaction
- **Interactive Feedback:** Hover effects with scaling (hover:scale-[1.02]) and accent borders
- **Clear Selection Buttons:** Each suggestion has a prominent "Select" button
- **Better Typography:** Improved font weights and spacing for clarity

#### **Improved User Interaction:**

- **Better Icons:** Larger, more prominent map pin icons (h-5 w-5 instead of h-4 w-4)
